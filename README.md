## Description
This project is one of my first projects in JAVA ever, I coded this simple version of XO game almost four years ago. recently I was messing around my old files and I found this project wich it reminded me how I was challenging my self trying to write some sorte a intilegence so I can play this game against him. I did actually came with an algorithm and it is a little bit good enough to play against. so here I'm sharing it with you.
